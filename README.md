 A weather app that uses the OpenWeather API and Expo Location to display the current weather conditions of the user's location! 🌤️🌡️🌬️

With just a tap of a reload icon, users can refresh the weather data and get the latest updates. Plus, a unit picker allows them to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit to display the temperature in their preferred units.

The app also displays additional weather data such as wind speed, humidity, and pressure, all provided by the API. And with the exact location of the user displayed on the app, they can always stay informed about the weather conditions in their area.
